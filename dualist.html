            <h2>NEON</h2>
            <p>Raised
                in Manila, Philippines, Tala Nicole Dimaapi Valdez is a Radiant empowered by her bioelectricity
                which
                has
                enlaced itself with Earth's radianite mesh<br> A young but former veteran at K/SEC, she was
                recruited by
                the
                VALORANT Protocol as part of their Omega Project,<br> specifically to utilize her electric
                abilities as
                they
                attempted to power an Alpha-Omega teleporter. Accepting a position there as their nineteenth
                agent,<br>
                "Neon",
                Valdez left her home to join the Protocol<br> and now seeks to help establish a stable
                connection that
                will
                finally allow the VP to cross over to Omega Earth.<br><br><br></p>

            <h2>JETT</h2>
            <p>
                Sunwoo Han hails from South Korea, with possible links to the Insa-dong neighborhood in
                Seoul.<br> As a
                chef
                in her early life, she was involved in an incident relating to her wind-like radiant powers at
                the
                restaurant she worked at,<br> causing a "freak storm" that all but destroyed the building.
                Sunwoo fled
                the
                scene soon after.<br>

                Later on, Sunwoo would be recruited by the VALORANT Protocol to become its tenth agent,<br>
                "Jett".
                Whilst
                working for the Protocol however, an incident occurred in Venice that destroyed part of the
                city.<br>
                When
                authorities issued warrants for the arrests of the perpetrators, one of them was revealed to
                look
                exactly identical to Jett.<br> Though Jett herself had nothing to do with the mission, the rest
                of the
                world
                now believed that she was now a threat to them.<br> She couldn't explain that it wasn't her to
                those she
                know outside of VALORANT, unable to even understand what was going on herself,<br> and it left
                them
                feeling
                disgusted, horrified, and ashamed at her, forcing her to go on the run once more.<br>

                It has since been understood that the lookalike was actually a mirror version of herself from
                another
                Earth<br> clearing Jett of any wrongdoing. Unable to reveal any info associated with the
                VALORANT
                Protocol
                however, and unable to convince anyone of her innocence in a population that knows nothing of
                alternate
                Earths, <br>to the rest of the world Jett remains one of its most dangerous
                radiants.<br><br><br></p>

            <h3>REYNA</h3>
            <p>Zyanya Mondragón is a Radiant from Mexico. After being affected by a disastrous event involving machines,
                Mondragón has a strong dislike for technology and humanity,<br> believing herself and her fellow
                Radiants to be the true future for Earth.<br> Before her time as a VALORANT Protocol agent, she set up a
                sanctuary to help people escape from Kingdom and heal, establishing a community there and becoming their
                protector and avenger.<br> As the Protocol's eleventh recruit, "Reyna", Mondragón continues to protect
                her
                city but now has a new audience to spread her philosophies amongst, consisting of the world's most
                powerful Radiants.<br> With some in the Protocol wary of her ways however, Reyna's Radiant future may
                have
                to wait for just a little longer.</p><br><br>

            <h3>YORU</h3>
            <p>
                A radiant from Tokyo, Japan, Ryo Kiritani is a man dedicated to uncovering his past. <br>Specifically
                interested in his ancestors and an ancient order of samurai, Kiritani's search has kept on bringing him
                to Kingdom's S22 container port.<br> On his first visit, he broke into the facility and stole a mask
                from a
                set of samurai armor that allowed him to see into another dimension. <br>He was later recruited by the
                VALORANT Protocol as its fifteenth agent, "Yoru", and shortly after this his familiarity with S22 saw
                him returning there on assignment to prevent a spike detonation by hostiles from Omega Earth.<br>

                Still not done with S22 however, Yoru continued to return to the site despite having other missions to
                do for the Protocol and against the advice of his superiors.<br> His research led him to discovering new
                information relating to both radianite and the alternate dimension that he could access and enter with
                his powers.<br> Finding a part of the ship with older dimensional fabric, Yoru suddenly fell through
                into a
                space that felt as if he was traveling from "now to then".<br> He pushed forward as far as he could and
                heard a woman's voice calling out to him, one he thought he recognized, but before he could answer back,
                the rift closed.<br><br><br></p>

            <h3>PHOENIX</h3>
            <p>Jamie Adeyemi is a Radiant hailing from the Peckham district in London, England.<br> Growing up, Adeyemi
                attended a Performing Arts school in the area but was later suspended.<br> Recruited into the VALORANT
                Protocol as its ninth agent, "Phoenix", Adeyemi was heavily involved with the Protocol's activities from
                10 AFL onwards.<br> With much information kept from him as need-to-know as a recent recruit, he was
                unable
                to prevent a spike detonation in Venice whilst on a solo mission.<br> Phoenix was given another
                opportunity
                to stop one the next day when another attack occurred in Rabat, and it was here that he first came
                face-to-face with the sole perpetrator, his own Omega counterpart.<br> Frustrated with how much was
                being
                kept in the dark, despite going on to prevent the detonation this time with the help of a team, Phoenix
                was finally filled in on the threat posed by Omega Earth.</p><br><br><br>

            <p>Tayane Alves is an engineer coming from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, with a strong enthusiasm for explosives

                sites there,<br> the marks of her tools staining the plots as a testament to her victories. Hired since
                then

                bigger
                threats to Earth. However<br>, as the paint fades from Salvador's walls, Raze cannot afford to leave her
                home completely behind, lest Kingdom look to make its return there.</p><br><br><br>
